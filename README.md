## Description of the app

This application is constructed in React, features the Google Map API and Foursquare API.

By default the app loads a few top locations situated in the Notre Dame area of Versailles. These locations are presented on the map as well as listed on the side of the map.
Clicking the marker on the map opens more information about the location chosen.
You can also click on the item in the list of locations to display more information.
Above the list of locations, there is a search input, where you can filter locations by their name.
Filtering the list also filters the markers on the map.
